        <h1>Components and Resonance</h1>

        <p>There are only three components that you need to understand.</p>

        <p><b>Resistor</b> is a component that <b>resists flow of electrical current</b> and its property of resistance is expressed in units of <b>Ohm</b>. Voltage and current are buddies and they go together through this one.</p>
        <p>In AC circuit we also need to know of impedance. Simplified, this is an opposition circuit presents to a current. It is, again extremely simplified, an form of resistance.</p>
        <p>Capacitor is a component that resists signals at low frequencies but passes whatever comes at high frequency. Increase in current will always come before any voltage increase. I simply remember that <b>capacitor loves high frequencies</b> (as it passes them) <b>and current</b> (as it leads).</p>
        <p>Inductor is a component that resists signals at high frequencies but passes whatever comes at low frequency. For it increase in voltage will always come before the current increase. It is essentially quite the opposite of how capacitor behaves. That is, <b>inductor loves low frequencies and voltage</b>.</p>
        <p><b>Resonance</b> is what happens when <b>inductive reactance is equal to capacitive reactance</b>. While there is a formula to calculate frequency at which this happens (and we will use it a bit further) only thing of importance here is that inductor and capacitor sort of &quot;cancel&quot; one another.</p>
        <p>These three components can be arranged either in series or parallel to one another. <b>If they are serial, at resonance input current is at maximum while circulating current will be at its minimum.</b></p>
        <p>Same components arranged in <b>parallel</b> will have input current at minimum while in resonance. At same time circulating current will be at its maximum – exactly the <b>opposite of serial arrangement</b>. Just remember series circuit behavior and you'll be fine.</p>

        
        <h2 id="E5A01">E5A01</h2>
        <p><b>What can cause the voltage across reactances in series to be larger than the voltage applied to them?</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li class="correct"><b>A. Resonance</b></li>
            <li>B. Capacitance</li>
            <li>C. Conductance</li>
            <li>D. Resistance</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This is kind of an odd ball – just remember it.</p>

        <h2 id="E5A02">E5A02</h2>
        <p><b>What is resonance in an electrical circuit?</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>A. The highest frequency that will pass current</li>
            <li>B. The lowest frequency that will pass current</li>
            <li class="correct"><b>C. The frequency at which the capacitive reactance equals the inductive reactance</b></li>
            <li>D. The frequency at which the reactive impedance equals the resistive impedance</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This comes directly out of definition for resonance and it is one of things you need to remember.</p>

        <h2 id="E5A03">E5A03</h2>
        <p><b>What is the magnitude of the impedance of a series RLC circuit at resonance?</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>A. High, as compared to the circuit resistance</li>
            <li>B. Approximately equal to capacitive reactance</li>
            <li>C. Approximately equal to inductive reactance</li>
            <li class="correct"><b>D. Approximately equal to circuit resistance</b></li>
        </ul>
        <p>RLC circuit is just a fancy name for something that consist of resistor (R), inductor (L), and capacitor (C). In this particular question they are arranged in series.</p>
        <p>As we can think of resonance as capacitor and inductor &quot;canceling&quot; one another, only thing left over is actual resistor and its impedance (opposition to current).</p>

        <h2 id="E5A04">E5A04</h2>
        <p><b>What is the magnitude of the impedance of a circuit with a resistor, an inductor and a capacitor all in parallel, at resonance?</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li class="correct"><b>A. Approximately equal to circuit resistance</b></li>
            <li>B. Approximately equal to inductive reactance</li>
            <li>C. Low, as compared to the circuit resistance</li>
            <li>D. Approximately equal to capacitive reactance</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Again, as in previous question, key word here is resonance. As capacitor and inductor &quot;cancel&quot; each other, only thing left over is resistor and its resistance.</p>

        <h2 id="E5A05">E5A05</h2>
        <p><b>What is the magnitude of the current at the input of a series RLC circuit as the frequency goes through resonance?</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>A. Minimum</li>
            <li class="correct"><b>B. Maximum</b></li>
            <li>C. R/L</li>
            <li>D. L/R</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If RLC are connected in series their input will be at maximum at resonance frequency. At same time circulating current will be at minimum.</p>

        <h2 id="E5A06">E5A06</h2>
        <p><b>What is the magnitude of the circulating current within the components of a parallel LC circuit at resonance?</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>A. It is at a minimum</li>
            <li class="correct"><b>B. It is at a maximum</b></li>
            <li>C. It equals 1 divided by the quantity 2 times Pi, multiplied by the square root of inductance L multiplied by capacitance C</li>
            <li>D. It equals 2 multiplied by Pi, multiplied by frequency &quot;F&quot;, multiplied by inductance &quot;L&quot;</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Circulating current is always opposite of input current. As parallel RLC circuit in resonance has input current in minimum, correct answer here is maximum current.</p>

        <h2 id="E5A07">E5A07</h2>
        <p><b>What is the magnitude of the current at the input of a parallel RLC circuit at resonance?</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li class="correct"><b>A. Minimum</b></li>
            <li>B. Maximum</li>
            <li>C. R/L</li>
            <li>D. L/R</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Input of parallel RLC circuit at resonance has exactly the opposite of behavior of serial circuit at resonance. As serial circuit has its input at maximum at resonance, here answer is minimum.</p>

        <h2 id="E5A08">E5A08</h2>
        <p><b>What is the phase relationship between the current through and the voltage across a series resonant circuit at resonance?</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>A. The voltage leads the current by 90 degrees</li>
            <li>B. The current leads the voltage by 90 degrees</li>
            <li class="correct"><b>C. The voltage and current are in phase</b></li>
            <li>D. The voltage and current are 180 degrees out of phase</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Resistor is as boring and passive as it gets. Voltage and current are buddies and in phase.</p>

        <h2 id="E5A09">E5A09</h2>
        <p><b>What is the phase relationship between the current through and the voltage across a parallel resonant circuit at resonance?</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>A. The voltage leads the current by 90 degrees</li>
            <li>B. The current leads the voltage by 90 degrees</li>
            <li class="correct"><b>C. The voltage and current are in phase</b></li>
            <li>D. The voltage and current are 180 degrees out of phase</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This is again case of boring resistor. Since at resonant frequency capacitor and inductor &quot;cancel&quot; each other only component doing anything is resistor. And resistor is boring and does nothing leaving voltage and current in phase. </p>
