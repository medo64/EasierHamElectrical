        <h1>Foreword</h1>
        <p>Taking an exam in order to get a ham license is quite stressful ordeal as it comes. To make things worse most people get extremely confused when dealing with calculations required. This guide will help you understand how to come to the answer as simply as possible and without calculator (which you will inevitably forget at home).</p>
        <p>In order to make things easier to remember physics here is extremely simplified and takes full advantage of rounding numbers and moving decimal point around to get us into a ballpark of an answer. It is what engineers around the world do when they refer to &quot;back of the envelope&quot; calculations.</p>
        <p>These simplifications work with Extra Class exam expiring on June 30, 2016. Most shortcuts will still apply for new exam but be warned that there might be some deviations.</p>
        <p>Only Electrical Principles part of an exam is covered here and you will need to use other resources too. I recommend <a href="http://www.kb6nu.com/study-guides/">No-Nonsense Study Guides by KB6NU</a> and do check for free classes at nearby Ham club. Ham radio is all about community â€“ there is no reason to pass through all this alone.</p>
