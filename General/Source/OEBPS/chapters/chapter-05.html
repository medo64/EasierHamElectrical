        <h1>Resistors, Capacitors, and Inductors; Oh My!</h1>
        <p>Transformer is just a weird inductors. Part that receives energy on primary and energy is &quot;converted&quot; on secondary windings.</p>
        <p><b>More resistors you have in line (series), the more resisting they will cause.</b> If they are connected in <b>parallel, total value will always be smaller than smallest individual resistor value</b>. If resistors are the same in size (e.g. three parallel resistors of 100 &#937;) final value will be individual value divided by number (100 &#937; / 3 ).</p>
        <p>Inductors follow the same parallel/serial values principle as resistors do.</p>
        <p><b>Capacitors</b> on other hand have their total value <b>increase when in parallel</b> and it is lower when in series.</p>
        <p>Prefixes <b>pico, nano, micro</b> are in ascending order. That is, picofarad capacitor would be much smaller than microfarad capacitor. Nanofarad falls in between.</p>

        <h2 id="G5C01">G5C01</h2>
        <p><b>What causes a voltage to appear across the secondary winding of a transformer when an AC voltage source is connected across its primary winding?</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>A. Capacitive coupling</li>
            <li>B. Displacement current coupling</li>
            <li class="correct"><b>C. Mutual inductance</b></li>
            <li>D. Mutual capacitance</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you look at transformer as a weird inductor and you remember that inductors love voltage, you’ll find the answer.</p>

        <h2 id="G5C02">G5C02</h2>
        <p><b>What happens if you reverse the primary and secondary windings of a 4:1 voltage step down transformer?</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li class="correct"><b>A. The secondary voltage becomes 4 times the primary voltage</b></li>
            <li>B. The transformer no longer functions as it is a unidirectional device</li>
            <li>C. Additional resistance must be added in series with the primary to prevent overload</li>
            <li>D. Additional resistance must be added in parallel with the secondary to prevent overload</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you reverse the windings, you reverse the roles of primary and secondary.</p>

        <h2 id="G5C03">G5C03</h2>
        <p><b>Which of the following components should be added to an existing resistor to increase the resistance?</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>A. A resistor in parallel</li>
            <li class="correct"><b>B. A resistor in series</b></li>
            <li>C. A capacitor in series</li>
            <li>D. A capacitor in parallel</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Resistors resist more when they are one after another.</p>

        <h2 id="G5C04">G5C04</h2>
        <p><b>What is the total resistance of three 100-ohm resistors in parallel?</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>A. 0.30 ohms</li>
            <li>B. 0.33 ohms</li>
            <li class="correct"><b>C. 33.3 ohms</b></li>
            <li>D. 300 ohms</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Resistors in parallel will have their total always smaller than any individual one. And since they are all the same value, you only need to divide them by 3.</p>

        <h2 id="G5C05">G5C05</h2>
        <p><b>If three equal value resistors in series produce 450 ohms, what is the value of each resistor?</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>A. 1500 ohms</li>
            <li>B. 90 ohms</li>
            <li class="correct"><b>C. 150 ohms</b></li>
            <li>D. 175 ohms</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We know that resistance is added if they are in series. Dividing 450 by 3 gives us 150.</p>

        <h2 id="G5C06">G5C06</h2>
        <p><b>What is the RMS voltage across a 500-turn secondary winding in a transformer if the 2250-turn primary is connected to 120 VAC?</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>A. 2370 volts</li>
            <li>B. 540 volts</li>
            <li class="correct"><b>C. 26.7 volts</b></li>
            <li>D. 5.9 volts</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This is just a matter of ratios. The more the turns, the higher the voltage. Since primary has around 2000 (rounded down) turns and secondary has 500 turns we know their ratio is 4:1. If we then apply the same ratio to 120 V from question we get 30 V. Closest value to 30 volts is 26.7 V.</p>

        <h2 id="G5C07">G5C07</h2>
        <p><b>What is the turns ratio of a transformer used to match an audio amplifier having a 600-ohm output impedance to a speaker having a 4-ohm impedance?</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li class="correct">A. 12.2 to 1</li>
            <li>B. 24.4 to 1</li>
            <li>C. 150 to 1</li>
            <li>D. 300 to 1</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Reflex answer here would be 150 to 1 and it would be true if we were dealing with voltages. However impedance has square relation with turn ratio. Square root of 150 is slightly more than 12 so that one is the correct answer. This question is kind of an oddball.</p>

        <h2 id="G5C08">G5C08</h2>
        <p><b>What is the equivalent capacitance of two 5.0 nanofarad capacitors and one 750 picofarad capacitor connected in parallel?</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>A. 576.9 nanofarads</li>
            <li>B. 1733 picofarads</li>
            <li>C. 3583 picofarads</li>
            <li class="correct"><b>D. 10.750 nanofarads</b></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Capacitors in parallel add their values. Just based on two 5 nanofarad capacitors we know there will be at least 10 nanofarads. Additional picofarad capacitor we can safely ignore.</p>

        <h2 id="G5C09">G5C09</h2>
        <p><b>What is the capacitance of three 100 microfarad capacitors connected in series?</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>A. 0.30 microfarads</li>
            <li>B. 0.33 microfarads</li>
            <li class="correct"><b>C. 33.3 microfarads</b></li>
            <li>D. 300 microfarads</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Capacitors behave opposite of resistors when placed in series. So values for three serial capacitors will behave same as for three parallel resistors.</p>

        <h2 id="G5C10">G5C10</h2>
        <p><b>What is the inductance of three 10 millihenry inductors connected in parallel?</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>A. 0.30 Henrys</li>
            <li>B. 3.3 Henrys</li>
            <li class="correct"><b>C. 3.3 millihenrys</b></li>
            <li>D. 30 millihenrys</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Same formula as for parallel resistors applies – just divide by 3.</p>

        <h2 id="G5C11">G5C11</h2>
        <p><b>What is the inductance of a 20 millihenry inductor in series with a 50 millihenry inductor?</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>A. 0.07 millihenrys</li>
            <li>B. 14.3 millihenrys</li>
            <li class="correct"><b>C. 70 millihenrys</b></li>
            <li>D. 1000 millihenrys</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Resistors and inductors both add their values when connected in series.</p>

        <h2 id="G5C12">G5C12</h2>
        <p><b>What is the capacitance of a 20 microfarad capacitor in series with a 50 microfarad capacitor?</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>A. 0.07 microfarads</li>
            <li class="correct"><b>B. 14.3 microfarads</b></li>
            <li>C. 70 microfarads</li>
            <li>D. 1000 microfarads</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Values of capacitors in series will behave as for resistors in parallel. That is, their value together will be just a smidge smaller than any one of them.</p>

        <h2 id="G5C13">G5C13</h2>
        <p><b>Which of the following components should be added to a capacitor to increase the capacitance?</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>A. An inductor in series</li>
            <li>B. A resistor in series</li>
            <li class="correct"><b>C. A capacitor in parallel</b></li>
            <li>D. A capacitor in series</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Capacitors in parallel behave as resistors and inductors in series, that is they increase their value.</p>

        <h2 id="G5C14">G5C14</h2>
        <p><b>Which of the following components should be added to an inductor to increase the inductance?</b></p>
        <ul>

            <li>B. A resistor in parallel</li>
            <li>C. An inductor in parallel</li>
            <li class="correct"><b>D. An inductor in series</b></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Both inductors and resistors increase their value when placed in series.</p>

        <h2 id="G5C15">G5C15</h2>
        <p><b>What is the total resistance of a 10 ohm, a 20 ohm, and a 50 ohm resistor in parallel?</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li class="correct"><b>A. 5.9 ohms</b></li>
            <li>B. 0.17 ohms</li>
            <li>C. 10000 ohms</li>
            <li>D. 80 ohms</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Total resistance of resistors in parallel will always be just a smidge below value lowest of them has.</p>

        <h2 id="G5C16">G5C16</h2>
        <p><b>Why is the conductor of the primary winding of many voltage step up transformers larger in diameter than the conductor of the secondary winding?</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>A. To improve the coupling between the primary and secondary</li>
            <li class="correct"><b>B. To accommodate the higher current of the primary</b></li>
            <li>C. To prevent parasitic oscillations due to resistive losses in the primary</li>
            <li>D. To insure that the volume of the primary winding is equal to the volume of the secondary winding</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Thicker the wire, bigger the current it supports.</p>

        <p><b>What is the value in nanofarads (nF) of a 22,000 pF capacitor?</b></p>

            <li>D. 220 nF</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Nanofarads are three zeros away from picofarads so we get correct answer by simply moving three decimal places to the left.</p>
