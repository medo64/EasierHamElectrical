        <h1>Basic Definitions</h1>
        <p>There are only three components you need to understand here.</p>
        <p><b>Resistor</b> is a component that <b>resists flow</b> of electrical current and its property of resistance is expressed in units of <b>Ohm</b> (&#937;).</p>
        <p>Capacitor is component that resists signals at low frequencies but passes whatever comes at high frequency. I personally simply remember that <b>capacitor loves high frequencies</b> (as it passes them)<b>.</b></p>
        <p>Inductor is component that resists signals at high frequencies but passes whatever comes at low frequency. It is essentially quite the opposite of how capacitor behaves. That is, <b>inductor loves low frequencies</b>.</p>
        <p><b>Impedance</b> is opposition to the <b>flow of current</b> in AC circuit. When connecting two components (e.g. feed line and antenna) <b>closer their impedances are, less power is lost</b>.</p>
        <p><b>Reactance</b> is pretty much the same thing as <b>impedance</b> but narrowed for <b>capacitance and/or inductance</b> in circuit only. Both have Ohm as a unit.</p>

        <h2 id="G5A01">G5A01</h2>
        <p><b>What is impedance?</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>A. The electric charge stored by a capacitor</li>
            <li>B. The inverse of resistance</li>
            <li class="correct"><b>C. The opposition to the flow of current in an AC circuit</b></li>
            <li>D. The force of repulsion between two similar electric fields</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As name says, something is impeded. In this case it is current.</p>

        <h2 id="G5A02">G5A02</h2>
        <p><b>What is reactance?</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>A. Opposition to the flow of direct current caused by resistance</li>
            <li class="correct"><b>B. Opposition to the flow of alternating current caused by capacitance or inductance</b></li>
            <li>C. A property of ideal resistors in AC circuits</li>
            <li>D. A large spark produced at switch contacts when an inductor is de-energized</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Impedance and reactance share quite a lot together. It is just that former is specific for capacitors and inductors.</p>

        <h2 id="G5A03">G5A03</h2>
        <p><b>Which of the following causes opposition to the flow of alternating current in an inductor?</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>A. Conductance</li>
            <li>B. Reluctance</li>
            <li>C. Admittance</li>
            <li class="correct"><b>D. Reactance</b></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Reactance applies to capacitor and inductor only.</p>

        <h2 id="G5A04">G5A04</h2>
        <p><b>Which of the following causes opposition to the flow of alternating current in a capacitor?</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>A. Conductance</li>
            <li>B. Reluctance</li>
            <li class="correct"><b>C. Reactance</b></li>
            <li>D. Admittance</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Reactance applies to both capacitor and inductor.</p>

        <h2 id="G5A05">G5A05</h2>
        <p><b>How does an inductor react to AC?</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>A. As the frequency of the applied AC increases, the reactance decreases</li>
            <li>B. As the amplitude of the applied AC increases, the reactance increases</li>
            <li>C. As the amplitude of the applied AC increases, the reactance decreases</li>
            <li class="correct"><b>D. As the frequency of the applied AC increases, the reactance increases</b></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Inductor loves low frequencies. As reactance is opposition to current, we can deduce that any rise in frequency will not be appreciated. For inductor increase in frequency leads to reactance (opposition) increase.</p>

        <h2 id="G5A06">G5A06</h2>
        <p><b>How does a capacitor react to AC?</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li class="correct"><b>A. As the frequency of the applied AC increases, the reactance decreases</b></li>
            <li>B. As the frequency of the applied AC increases, the reactance increases</li>
            <li>C. As the amplitude of the applied AC increases, the reactance increases</li>
            <li>D. As the amplitude of the applied AC increases, the reactance decreases</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Capacitor loves high frequencies and thus it wonâ€™t oppose any increase. As reactance is a measure of opposition we can tell that capacitor will have it decrease as frequency increases.</p>

        <h2 id="G5A07">G5A07</h2>
        <p><b>What happens when the impedance of an electrical load is equal to the output impedance of a power source, assuming both impedances are resistive?</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>A. The source delivers minimum power to the load</li>
            <li>B. The electrical load is shorted</li>
            <li>C. No current can flow through the circuit</li>
            <li class="correct"><b>D. The source can deliver maximum power to the load</b></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Any mismatch in impedance will cause loss of power. No mismatch - maximum power to the load.</p>

        <h2 id="G5A08">G5A08</h2>
        <p><b>Why is impedance matching important?</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li class="correct"><b>A. So the source can deliver maximum power to the load</b></li>
            <li>B. So the load will draw minimum power from the source</li>
            <li>C. To ensure that there is less resistance than reactance in the circuit</li>
            <li>D. To ensure that the resistance and reactance in the circuit are equal</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Any mismatch in impedance will cause loss of power.</p>

        <h2 id="G5A09">G5A09</h2>
        <p><b>What unit is used to measure reactance?</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>A. Farad</li>
            <li class="correct"><b>B. Ohm</b></li>
            <li>C. Ampere</li>
            <li>D. Siemens</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Pretty much any opposition or resistance is measured in ohms. This goes for reactance too.</p>

        <h2 id="G5A10">G5A10</h2>
        <p><b>What unit is used to measure impedance?</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>A. Volt</li>
            <li class="correct"><b>B. Ohm</b></li>
            <li>C. Ampere</li>
            <li>D. Watt</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As impedance is a form of resistance, it is too measured in ohms.</p>

        <h2 id="G5A11">G5A11</h2>
        <p><b>Which of the following describes one method of impedance matching between two AC circuits?</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li class="correct"><b>A. Insert an LC network between the two circuits</b></li>
            <li>B. Reduce the power output of the first circuit</li>
            <li>C. Increase the power output of the first circuit</li>
            <li>D. Insert a circulator between the two circuits</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Inductor and capacitor are magical components when it comes to adjustment of impedance.</p>

        <h2 id="G5A12">G5A12</h2>
        <p><b>What is one reason to use an impedance matching transformer?</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>A. To minimize transmitter power output</li>
            <li class="correct"><b>B. To maximize the transfer of power</b></li>
            <li>C. To reduce power supply ripple</li>
            <li>D. To minimize radiation resistance</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If we match impedance we will reduce power loss and thus maximize power transfer.</p>

        <h2 id="G5A13">G5A13</h2>
        <p><b>Which of the following devices can be used for impedance matching at radio frequencies?</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>A. A transformer</li>
            <li>B. A Pi-network</li>
            <li>C. A length of transmission line</li>
            <li class="correct"><b>D. All of these choices are correct</b></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Transformer is just special inductor, Pi-network is &quot;just&quot; some inductors and capacitors thrown together. And any length of wire will exhibit inductance too. So all choices are correct here.</p>
