        <h1>Decibels</h1>
        <p>Decibels look weird as they use logarithms. They become just an exercise in conversion once you understand that <b>every 3 dB is doubling of power</b>. Assuming you start with 1 W, 3 dB increase will be 2 W; 6 dB increase will be 4 W; and 9 dB increase will be 8 W. Conveniently 10 dB is same as tenfold increase.</p>
        <p><b>A single dB is around 20% of a value</b>.</p>

        <h2 id="G5B01">G5B01</h2>
        <p><b>A two-times increase or decrease in power results in a change of how many dB?</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>A. Approximately 2 dB</li>
            <li class="correct"><b>B. Approximately 3 dB</b></li>
            <li>C. Approximately 6 dB</li>
            <li>D. Approximately 12 dB</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Every 3 dB we double the power.</p>

        <h2 id="G5B10">G5B10</h2>
        <p><b>What percentage of power loss would result from a transmission line loss of 1 dB?</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>A. 10.9%</li>
            <li>B. 12.2%</li>
            <li class="correct"><b>C. 20.5%</b></li>
            <li>D. 25.9%</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Single dB will increase/decrease value by around 20%.</p>
